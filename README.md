## How It Works

The app uses a fallback system for image generation:
1. **Primary**: Hugging Face Inference API (free tier available)
2. **Fallback**: Pollinations AI (free, no API key needed)
3. **Final Fallback**: Placeholder images

## Supported AI Models

- DALL-E 3
- And many more through Hugging Face

## Usage

1. Enter a descriptive prompt (e.g., "A magical forest with glowing mushrooms")
2. Click "Generate Image"
3. Wait for the AI to create your image
4. Download or view in the history gallery
